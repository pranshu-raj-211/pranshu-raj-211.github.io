I’m a backend engineer who loves working with data and solving real-world problems through code.  

Here, I share my projects, experiments, and insights into distributed systems, algorithms, and infrastructure. Lately, I’ve been diving into high-performance trading systems, on-demand compute, and efficient data pipelines.  

I’ve always been fascinated by what happens beneath the surface of software—how data moves through a system, what makes a service scale efficiently, and how the right architecture choices can mean the difference between something that just works and something that performs at an entirely different level.  

This blog is a mix of deep dives, experiments, and real-world lessons from the projects I build. Some of my ideas work, some don’t, but either way, I document what I learn along the way. If you're into solving complex problems with clean, efficient solutions, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranshuraj2004/).
