## Getting started

I'm building this blog as a way to keep track of what I've learned, and to share my learnings with others, to collaborate on topics that I find interesting.

I'm currently working on understanding concurrency patterns through building protocols from scratch (think websockets and https using bare sockets).

I also love to work with data, I recently revisited Airflow and Kafka to understand how they work under the hood.
