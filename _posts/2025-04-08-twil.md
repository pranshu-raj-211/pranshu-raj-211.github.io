# This week I learned

Here's a curated collection of stuff that I learned and found to be really cool while doomscrolling.

1. **Redis pipelines and transactions**
    - Context: Building a rate limiter
    - Source: 
      - https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/pipelining/
      - https://x.com/hnasr/status/1909247320966975503
    - TODO: 
      - Try scaling a rate limiter built using Redis
      - Discover how pipelining, transactions are implemented, their features and tradeoffs. 
      - Check on what https://x.com/83NITO_X 's building


2. **Binding docker container ports to localhost**
    - Context: Prevent firewall bypass, database access. Always use proxies in front of containers.
    - Source:
      - https://x.com/hnasr/status/1909446544392376802
    - TODO:
      - Try to bypass those rules, understand how this binding works.
      - Try proxying with databases (db proxy - package main - youtube video).


## This week I built
1. A basic rate limiter with Redis. Add monitoring and see how much it can scale vertically.
2. Refactored concall-parser.
3. A POC on scoring conversational agents.
