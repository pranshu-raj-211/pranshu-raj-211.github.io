# This week I learned

A list of things that I came across this week which seem to be pretty cool.

1. **Why should we not use vector databases?**
	I first came across this concept while going through vector sets on Redis. Current vector databases use a secondary index as the vector index, contrary to making the vector the main thing as done in vector sets. I intend to explore this idea in more detail.

## This week I built
1. A RL framework for optimization of traffic signals. Learnt a lot about deep RL, GNN and SUMO in the process. Check it out [here](https://github.com/pranshu-raj-211/dmdqn). Wandb runs hosted [here](https://wandb.ai/pranshuraj65536/dqn_multi_agent_traffic).
2. Backend part of [research assistant](), to solve problems I faced while doing research last year. There's a YC company doing the same thing, but I'd prefer a local solution.

## What I'm reading

I've been looking into building websocket servers at scale as part of my tinychess project (local, simplified version of lichess). I know it won't need nearly as much scale, still it's really interesting to see how this works.

4. [Reward hacking in RL](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-11-28-reward-hacking/): I discovered this blog from [Saurabh Kumar](https://x.com/drummatick)'s twitter, and it explains one of the reasons why my RL agent was so awful.
